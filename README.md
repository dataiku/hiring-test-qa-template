## First steps

If you don’t know where to start, you can follow these steps:

1. Explore the app and start establishing a first version of the test plan
2. Report all bugs you find during your exploration
3. Bootstrap a framework to interact with the application. This can be either an API-based framework, a UI framework or both. However, we advise you to start with the API framework.
4. Choose an impacting bug you found in step 2 and create an automated test for it
5. Create a test for the following user story: “As User A, I should be able to see the tasks created by User B”
6. Add more coverage to your test suite and improve your framework accordingly
7. Think about improvements and limitation of your project
